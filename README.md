The car realizes this features:
  
  avoidance: regrettably, we only use one distance sensor in the first mission, I'm sure it will be modified perfectly later;
  
  go forward/backward,turn right, spin, stop;
  
  if the plant need more light, the car will take it to somewhere with abundant sunlight. 
  
  thanks to 正点原子, their models give me lots of helps.
